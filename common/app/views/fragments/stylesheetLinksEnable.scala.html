@*
The css is loaded by the `link`s in stylesheetLinks.scala.html, but with media of "only x".
This means the browser requests it, but doesn't block rendering on it, since this media is
not 'x'. Once it's loaded (appears in `window.document.styleSheets`),  `media` is set to
`screen` so the browser uses it.
